#programming about logic , store data and dealing with data
# different types of data: how do arrange or organize data, types of data using python
# it has sequences : nothing but countiniues collectoins of datatype. indexing or slizing.
# operation of sequence operation is
# concatenation : join 2 sequences and create new sequences
# repetition:
# membership testing: check variable is member or not of a sequence
# slicing: slice a sub portion of  any sequence [index 1-index 4]
# indexing: items are indexed from 0

types of sequencing in python
lists:
  1. its a data type 
  2. with [] and ,
  3. update list, list length, repetition, concatenation, delete list elements, slicing, pop 
  4. used for sequence accessing and processing
  
string
dictionaries
tuples
